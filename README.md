Use a Python script to batch convert MATLAB .p files to .m files.
Reference: https://github.com/meilinxiaoxue/ptom_c

pFile2m.exe is generated by packaging the pfile2m.py script.

ptom.exe has been recompiled using main.c and ptom.c, and it depends on the zlib1.dll library.

Several bugs in ptom.c have been fixed, including:

Missing spaces after control keywords (e.g., if, for, switch)

Insufficient memory allocation that led to conversion failures

main.c has been modified mainly to make it compatible with the Python script.
