MATLAB .p to .m File Converter
This project provides tools to batch convert MATLAB .p files into readable .m files, with improved formatting and better compatibility for further editing and review.

Version Update
Formatted the decoded .m files to make them easier for users to read.

Resolved most syntax errors.

Fixed issues with missing spaces after control keywords (e.g., if, for, switch).

Improved memory allocation to prevent conversion failures.

References
MATLAB Formatter for VSCode
(Recommended for post-processing and formatting the converted .m files.)

ptom_c
(Original C implementation used as the base for conversion.)

Components
pFile2m.exe
Generated by packaging the pfile2m.py script.

Provides a Python-based batch conversion of .p files to .m files.

Suitable for automating conversions in Windows environments.

ptom.exe
Recompiled from main.c and ptom.c.

Depends on zlib1.dll.

Several bugs have been fixed:

Missing spaces after control keywords.

Insufficient memory allocation causing crashes.

main.c
Updated to improve compatibility with the Python script workflow.

Ensures smoother integration when called programmatically.

Usage
Batch Conversion

Use pFile2m.exe to convert multiple .p files in a folder to .m files.

Formatting

After conversion, apply the MATLAB Formatter for VSCode to further clean up code formatting.

Dependencies

Ensure zlib1.dll is available in your system PATH when using ptom.exe.
